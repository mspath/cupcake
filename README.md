# Cupcake app

This app is part of the [Android Basics in Kotlin] course from Google, see [Unit 3] [Pathway 3] and the [Shared ViewModel Across Fragments] Codelab and the [Navigation and the back stack] Codelab.

This app contains an order flow for cupcakes with options for quantity, flavor, and pickup date. The order details get displayed on an order summary screen and can be shared to another app to send the order.

This app demonstrates multiple fragments in an activity, a shared ViewModel across fragments,
data binding, LiveData, and the Jetpack Navigation component.
